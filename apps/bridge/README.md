# Gaius 转译节点（RelayNode）

RelayNode is the self-hostable multiplayer component of Gaius. It creates one
temporary WebSocket-to-TCP tunnel per browser connection for Minecraft status
pings and play traffic. It does not store worlds or run the single-player
server, so volunteers can contribute nodes without hosting the game itself.

Run a local node:

```sh
GAIUS_BRIDGE_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
GAIUS_BRIDGE_PORT=8080 \
GAIUS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://play.example,null \
GAIUS_ALLOWED_HOSTS='*.example.net,mc.example.org' \
GAIUS_ALLOWED_RESOURCE_PACK_HOSTS='cdn.example.net,gitlab.com' \
GAIUS_BRIDGE_TOKEN=replace-me \
GAIUS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS=10000 \
GAIUS_MAXIMUM_CONNECTIONS=256 \
GAIUS_TARGET_AFFINITY_MS=300000 \
GAIUS_MAXIMUM_TARGET_ROUTES=4096 \
GAIUS_RESOURCE_PACK_CACHE_MS=300000 \
GAIUS_RESOURCE_PACK_CACHE_BYTES=536870912 \
GAIUS_RESOURCE_PACK_CACHE_ENTRIES=64 \
GAIUS_RELAY_NODE_NAME='Example RelayNode' \
npm start
```

Use a TLS reverse proxy for public nodes so the browser endpoint is
`wss://relay.example/tunnel`. A node also exposes
`https://relay.example/relay-node/v1` and `/health`, which report the RelayNode
protocol version, supported tunnel features, capacity, and whether a token is
required. `null` in `GAIUS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` permits a
downloaded `file://` Gaius HTML file; omit it when portable clients should not
use the node. `/health` returns the active and maximum connection counts.

`GAIUS_ALLOWED_HOSTS` controls Minecraft TCP destinations.
When the RelayNode listens on a non-loopback address, private, loopback,
link-local, carrier-grade NAT, multicast, and DNS-resolved private targets are
blocked by default even if this list contains `*`. Set
`GAIUS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=1` only for a trusted LAN deployment.
`GAIUS_ALLOWED_RESOURCE_PACK_HOSTS` independently controls HTTP(S) server-pack
downloads and defaults to the TCP host list for compatibility. Set the latter
to the CDN domains used by the allowed servers; this avoids opening arbitrary
TCP destinations just because a server hosts its pack elsewhere.

Resource-pack bodies are downloaded to a size-limited temporary file before
the RelayNode sends response headers to Chrome. If an upstream CDN cuts a body
short, the node retries the complete GET up to three times; the browser receives
only a complete response with an exact `Content-Length`. A completed `200`
response is retained in a bounded five-minute disk cache keyed by the complete
URL and forwarded Minecraft headers, so status-to-join and nearby players do
not redownload the same pack from a slow CDN. `GAIUS_RESOURCE_PACK_CACHE_MS`,
`GAIUS_RESOURCE_PACK_CACHE_BYTES`, and `GAIUS_RESOURCE_PACK_CACHE_ENTRIES`
control or disable that cache. Client disconnects cancel unfinished upstream
downloads without retrying, and all temporary files are removed on eviction,
failure, or RelayNode exit. Mojang authentication, player textures, Realms, and
the blocked-server list use the same origin/token-gated HTTP proxy. Their
idempotent GET requests also retry transient network failures and 429/502/503/504
responses; authentication and Realms write requests are never replayed.

The public registry rejects token-protected nodes because it never publishes a
shared tunnel secret to browsers. A public wildcard node can reach arbitrary
public Minecraft servers, but still needs upstream rate limiting, per-IP
connection quotas, traffic accounting and an abuse contact. Private nodes can
use `GAIUS_BRIDGE_TOKEN` and a restricted `GAIUS_ALLOWED_HOSTS` list. A node
operator can give players its URL. The browser accepts either a legacy string
or a node object in `gaius.bridgeNodes`; objects can carry their own token and
priority:

```json
[
  {"url":"https://relay.example", "priority":100},
  {"url":"wss://backup.example/tunnel", "token":"node-token", "priority":10}
]
```

For every multiplayer status ping or join, the browser first attempts the
same-host Gaius server plugin while it queries every discovered RelayNode at
`/relay-node/v1?host=...&port=...`. It prefers a node with an active connection
to that normalized Minecraft target, then a node that reached it recently,
then available capacity and configured priority. A string URL and repeated
`bridge` query parameters remain supported. Target-specific manifest queries
use the node token when configured and never expose the node's other targets.
The browser retains a failed direct-plugin probe for 30 seconds and successful
RelayNode manifest results for 15 seconds. This removes the repeated discovery
delay between a server-list ping and the subsequent join without reusing their
WebSocket or TCP streams.

Affinity only reuses the selected RelayNode. Every browser channel still opens
its own WebSocket and its own Minecraft TCP connection; protocol streams are
never shared between players, status pings, or reconnects. A tunnel is usable
only after its `connected` control response, which means that node reached the
requested Java server. `GAIUS_TARGET_AFFINITY_MS` controls how long a successful
target remains preferred after its last connection, and
`GAIUS_MAXIMUM_TARGET_ROUTES` bounds retained inactive route records.
The temporary unit is the tunnel lease, not the RelayNode process. Closing the
browser channel cancels an in-progress TCP dial or destroys its connected TCP
socket immediately. When the last player leaves, the target's active count is
zero; only bounded, expiring reachability metadata remains for later node
selection and it carries no open server connection.
The manifest publishes `targetConnectTimeoutMs`, and the browser derives a
larger end-to-end tunnel budget from it so an SRV timeout can still fall back to
the entered host and port. `GAIUS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` controls each RelayNode
TCP attempt. Closing the browser tunnel cancels any attempt still in progress.

The downloaded HTML cannot start a process on another machine. Volunteer nodes
must already be deployed and listed in the curated root `relay-nodes.json`, a
leased live registry, a custom `relayRegistry`, `gaius.bridgeNodes`, or a
`bridge` query parameter. The portable HTML embeds the registry snapshot and
refreshes it from GitHub when it has network access. A root registry can point
to a live registry, so contributors can renew short leases without rebuilding
the client. The client discovers which node already has affinity for the
entered server and opens a new isolated tunnel there; if none does, it selects
an available node and establishes the first tunnel. See
[`docs/relay-nodes.md`](../../docs/relay-nodes.md) for the contribution and
security requirements.

By default, the RelayNode replies to the exact unencrypted 1.21 keepalive frame
while the browser is busy reloading a server resource pack. This prevents a
backend read timeout during a long main-thread reload without inspecting or
modifying ordinary game packets. It also emits the payloadless 1.21.11 client
tick after configuration enters PLAY, then replays the client's exact tick
frame while the browser is stalled. The relay tracks the reversible 1.21.11
`PLAY -> CONFIGURATION -> PLAY` transition: it stops synthetic PLAY ticks as
soon as the server sends Start Configuration, proxies configuration keepalives,
and resumes only after the client finishes the new configuration cycle. Set
`GAIUS_PROXY_KEEPALIVES=0` to disable this behavior.
Encrypted online-mode traffic is opaque and remains fully transparent.

Run the focused protocol test with:

```sh
npm run smoke
```

The smoke test injects two interrupted 20 MiB resource-pack responses, requires
the third response to reach the client with its original SHA-1, verifies a
second cache hit without another upstream request, and ensures a browser abort
does not start a retry. The
local protocol fixture also forces a complete PLAY reconfiguration and rejects
any PLAY tick injected before configuration finishes. Set
`GAIUS_SMOKE_PLAY_SOAK_MS=60000` with `GAIUS_SMOKE_MINECRAFT_HOST` to keep a
real server connection alive and validate any server-initiated reconfiguration.
The
optional public-server path also understands vanilla 1.21.11 server
dialogs and Code of Conduct confirmation before entering PLAY. Prompt handling
is disabled unless the smoke process is explicitly started with
`GAIUS_SMOKE_ACCEPT_SERVER_PROMPTS=1`. Text fields must also be supplied as a
JSON object in `GAIUS_SMOKE_DIALOG_INPUTS_JSON`; for example, an offline server
registration test can provide `{"password":"...","confirm":"..."}`. Use a
disposable test account because registration changes server state. The
production client keeps the normal visible screens and never accepts a server
policy or submits credentials silently.

## Container deployment

The repository includes one container definition for both the RelayNode and
its optional lease registry. The compose example starts both processes. Copy
`compose.example.yaml` to `compose.yaml`, replace every example hostname,
origin and registry token, then start it behind a TLS reverse proxy:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

Expose RelayNode `/health` and `/relay-node/v1` through HTTPS and `/tunnel`
through WSS. Expose registry `/relay-nodes.json` through HTTPS, but keep the
lease write endpoint and `GAIUS_REGISTRY_TOKEN` restricted to trusted node
operators. Do not publish ports 8080 or 8083 directly to the public Internet
unless an upstream proxy enforces TLS, rate limits and request accounting.

For a public node, use the TLS-ready example instead of exposing either Node.js
process directly:

```sh
cp public.env.example .env
# Edit both DNS names, the allowed client origins, node identity, and secret.
docker compose --env-file .env -f compose.public.example.yaml up -d --build
```

`compose.public.example.yaml` runs the registry and RelayNode on a private
Compose network. Caddy is the only service with host ports: it obtains TLS,
serves the RelayNode manifest and WSS tunnel on `GAIUS_RELAY_DOMAIN`, and exposes
only `/relay-nodes.json` plus `/health` on `GAIUS_REGISTRY_DOMAIN`. The bearer
token lease endpoint is deliberately unavailable through Caddy. Add
`https://<GAIUS_REGISTRY_DOMAIN>/relay-nodes.json` to the root
`relay-nodes.json` only after the public health and manifest URLs work.
